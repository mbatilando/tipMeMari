A simple tip calculator in Swift and iOS8

**How many hours did it take to complete?**
The prework took me 2.5 hours. Styling and creating the UI took the longest.

**Which required and optional stories have you completed?**
I used a UISlider element to adjust the tip value.

I also made my design adaptive so that it works on different screen sizes and in landscape
mode.

**GIF walkthrough of all required and optional stories.**
