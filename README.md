A simple tip calculator in Swift and iOS8

**How many hours did it take to complete?**

The prework took me 4 hours. Styling and creating the UI took the longest.

**Which required and optional stories have you completed?**

**Required (All Completed)**

Users will be able to calculate their total given a tip percentage.

They can also set their default tip percentage in the settings view.

**Optional**

I used a UISlider element to adjust the tip so that it works for any value.

I made my design adaptive so that it works on different screen sizes and in landscape
mode.

I designed the launch screen.
